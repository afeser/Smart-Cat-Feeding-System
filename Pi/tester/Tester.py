# Definitions :
# 1) Sometimes it is confusing that which side is server. Usually streaming side
# is assumed to be the server. However, in this configuration to clearly define
# the virtual machine server, server always refer to virtual machine.
#    Server : virtual machine server
#    Client : raspberry pi zero


# TODO(s)
# 1) Error-Handling
# 2) Logging
# 3) Connection lost-reconnection

    # To be optimized for performance. Used in stream server.

    # Frame per second, how many frames will the client send in sendFrame mode
    # Moreover, it can be dynamic in the future depending on the vision algorithm
    # Notice increasing fps results in overflow in socket buffer...
