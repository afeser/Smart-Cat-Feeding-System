# METU EEE 2020 - Capstone Project

The project is developed based on ProjectDefinition.md file. It is a smart cat feeding project that can detect, identify and feed cats intelligently using machine learning, computer vision and control. Due to COVID-19 pandemic, some parts of the project is left incomplete. Version 1 prototype is ready, but unfortunately, version 2 prototype will not be completed.

Computer vision, electronic board, user interface and mechanic designs are available and tested with prototype 1. Computer vision part is improved for identification and gives practical results. More information on the test results are included in the final report. Web interface is ready to be used and also is included.

## Installation
Simply run "setup" file as a bash script. Arguments specify whether build is for client or server.

Under "build" folder, there are files to make the system work.
