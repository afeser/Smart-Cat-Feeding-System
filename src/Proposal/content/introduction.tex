\subsection{Motivation}
% Think about a cat alone in darkness with a hungry stomach waiting for her owner.

Are cats only a means to joy for humans, or are they rather precious companions? It is easier to answer this question after a quick reminder of a historical event: In \(14^{th}\) century, Europe was swept over by a plague, mainly resulted by the bites of infected rats, lice and mice. People of Europe at the time were certain that this plague was God's punishment, so the `logical' reaction was to execute Jews and alleged witches. During this manhunt, some communities also massacred village cats, thinking they were associated with witches. The removal of cats from the equation allowed a crazy amount of infected rats to continue spreading the disease, which gave way to the infamous black death.

\subsection{Related Work}
The current autonomous cat feeding systems have only a few capabilities and are quite costly. The state of the art, according to an article on most rated automatic cat feeding systems of 2019 \cite{cite:SOTA}, has several key features. These are large food storage capacity, portion control settings, kibble size options and pet-proofing. This system costs 150 dollars. However, we intend to achieve all of this with extra capabilities with a maximum budget of 200 dollars. The proposed system will identify and recognize different cats and track their dietary plans. In addition to this, the proportions will be distributed regarding their adiposity. The system will be capable of feeding a large number of cats making it adoptable for usage in campuses and homes with populous cats. The system's reservoir will be adequate to feed more than 20 cats for the duration of the battery lifetime, 10 hours.

There are various parameters involving a cat's appetite like its age, gender, weight, environmental factors and the brand of cat food. With the change of the brand the kcal per kg, kibble  size, volume per gram also changes. Therefore, the calculations were held under many assumptions and idealizations. An average cat weighing 4kg needs to consume approximately 253 kcal/day \cite{cite:DIET}. This corresponds to an average of 60 grams of dry cat food per day. For a 10 hour span the food consumption per cat is 25grams which is nearly 50ml in volume. Accepting the reservoir volume to be 5 litres, the cats that can be fed will be 100. Since there were many assumptions as mentioned these numbers have are not as realistic. However, the conclusion can be made that the designed system can easily achieve the system's goals. 

\subsection{Societal Impact}
Societal marketing is one of the main concepts in the sustainable marketing environment. Companies have been developing techniques to create a sustainable world by putting some regulations into practice. Marketing have advanced such that society now have stronger impact on the market. Figure \ref{fig:intro_societalMarketing} shows the balance between company-customer-society where Felerest aims to create sustainable and social environment. \cite{bib:intro_societalMarketing}.

Felerest minds environment by reducing trash, leftover, health risks, and energy consumption. The design allows the users to easily replace broken parts by simply breaking down into sub-systems which diminishes the trash generated in repair phase and makes it impossible to impose planned obsolescence. Moreover, regulated food drop mechanism prevents cats from overweight, and provides a healthy diet whereas leftover completely disappears. In addition to these environmental effects, it consumes only a little power to run continuously, which reduces the $CO_2$ emission and keep the world sustainable. Finally, protecting the environment and creating a sustainable world plays an important role in Felerest group because Felerest feels it is responsible for the society and the future generations.
