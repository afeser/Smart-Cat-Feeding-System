\label{sec:conclusion}

This report tackles the problems of "cat feeding" and  its variants such as "optimal food mass", the mass of the food that best satisfies the cat needs, "multiple cat feeding", and "efficient cat feeding".

The project explains the problem and the proposed design approach with a powerful solution. Thanks to Felerest technologies, these problems have robust solutions. Moreover, obesity in cat kind, invasion of cat habitats by feral dogs, contamination of the world by overproduction, consuming much for the environment are the key problems that the project promises to solve. As discussed before, the project develops methods for reducing food consumption and providing correct amounts of fresh food for cats.

Total cost is a considerable value; further, it is a very reasonable price when compared to the present solutions, considering additional benefits. The availability of the market and purchasing power support the business, which is why the company aims to be the leader in the future.

Consequently, the report demonstrates the long term profile, workflow, work plan, and organization of the company as well as its growth expectations. The project exhibits powerful potential, in addition to the creation of the right environment for the investors.
