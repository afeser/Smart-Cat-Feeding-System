# Critical Design Review Report

It is expected that essential parts of the system design should not change after the submission of this report.

As a rule of thumb 75% to 90% of all product design should be complete. Note that, all critical module designs are expected to be frozen (100% completed) at this point.

You should follow a top-down approach for this rreport. 

Submitted report fully complies with the technical report writing rules. Spelling, punctuation and grammar mistakes are minimum. The organization of the report is easy to follow and understand. 

## What is expected?

### System under review can proceed into:

+ System fabrication

+ demonstration

+ test

### System under review can meet stated performance requiements:

+ within budget

+ schedule

+ other system constraints

## What should be included?

+ A detailed description of the overall system supported by system and subsystem level block diagrams, flow charts, and technical drawings of the expected final product (preferably 3D), each on a separate page showing details. All control and data signals within the system should be illustrated clearly including any feedback paths. All the blocks and the signals should be clearly labelled.

+ A summary of any design modifications made on the system described in the conceptual design report with justifications. Justifications must also be provided for the parts that are unmodified with supporting material (e.g., test results, simulation results).

+ Detailed requirements of all sub-systems (you should follow a top-down approach, where high-level overview of the system is presented before the low-level details).

+ A discussion on the compatibility between sub-systems and their signal interfaces within the overall design.

+ Justification that the designed system will satisfy the customer and engineering requirements.

+ Test results, encountered problems, and implemented/proposed solutions.

+ A discussion on the robustness of your design against expected error sources.

+ Updated cost breakdown and analysis (discussion on your choices among alternatives).

+ An up-to-date development schedule (with a Gantt Chart).
 
+ A power distribution diagram and a power management analysis (resources and consumption) for the system.

## General Reminders

+ Software codes should not be given (only partially in appendices, if absolutely needed). Only Software architectural notes and details can be presented as a part of the main text.

+ Please avoid dumping data sheets, reference designs, etc. in the text as these are distracting from the focus of your report. Only segments from relevant data sheets can be given, and preferably in appendices.

+ Using illustrative diagrams, tables, and lists are strongly recommended over writing long explanatory texts.

## Proposed Table of Contents

+ ### Executive Summary

+ ### Introduction

+ ### Overall System Description

Supported by system and subsystem level block diagrams, flow charts, and 3D drawings of the expected final product, each on a separate page showing details. 

All control and data signals within the system are illustrated clearly including any feedback paths.

All the blocks and the signals are clearly labelled.

  + #### Test Procedures and Assesment of Test Results
  
  A test plan for each subsystem is provided along with the expected quantitative test results for success. Test results, encountered problems, and implemented/proposed solutions are clearly indicated and discussed. 

  + #### Requirements
  
 System and subsystem level requirements are illustrated in detail in a structural manner. 
 
  + #### Design Modifications
  No modifications to the conceptual design are done with justifications or design modifications at the system level and subsystem level are explained in detail with full justifications. 

  + #### Compatibility Analysis of Overall System
  
  A detailed discussion on the compatibility between subsystems is provided. Their signal interfaces are clearly described.
