\section{Executive Summary}
\label{sec:executiveSummary}

Cats and humans are historical friends. It is estimated that there exists 200-600 million cats (as pets) around the world \cite{cite:wikihuman}.
%(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_interaction_with_cats#cite_note-3), 
80 million cats alone are owned by humans living in USA \cite{cite:natgeocat}.
Although the existence of many cats, the current feeding diets are far from enough. They are either fed only when their owners are around or they are faced with the challenge of finding food for themselves in the case of street cats. These conditions are not hygienic for either humans or cats. The mission of Felerest is to create a safe and clean environment for the closest companions throughout history: cats and people. 

In order to solve this problem Felerest proposes an autonomous cat feeding system. This system aims to feed cats without any human attraction other than charging the system and inserting food into the reservoir. This system will be able to adjust itself to the eating habits for every single cat and will give the specified amount of food among many other features.
