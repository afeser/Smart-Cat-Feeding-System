\section{Overall System} \label{sec:overall_system}
Overall system design consists of multiple subsystems which work in a black box manner. Abstraction is the key property used in the design of overall system as well as subsystems. Each part designed for a specific interface which is then used by other parts. This abstraction and interface structure are also used in software design and implementation. 

The overall system is controlled by the Controller. Controller manages every subsystem and connects them to operate the system in a consistent manner. Controller requires various subsystems to be functional. The subsystems Controller directly communicates are Video Server, Command Server, User Interface, Image Processor, Decision Maker, Database. Figure \ref{fig:overAllSystemOrganization} in appendix A demonstrates the overall organization of the system. In the rest of the report, the subsystems are analyzed and presented. More information about bringing the subsystems to form the overall system will be presented in the integration part. Furthermore, more information explaining the implementation of the modules that form the subsystem are given in detail in each subsystem's section.
