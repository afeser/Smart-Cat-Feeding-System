# Smart Connected Cat Feeding & Monitoring System

Design an automatic, smart, and connected cat feeding and monitoring system with a refilling mechanism.

There are serious problems with “manual” feeding. In order to solve these problems, the device should be automatic and  “smart” such that

- The system should feed only cats.
- The system should be able to identify new cats and recognize them later. 
- The system should deter dogs (without giving any harm) from the area. 
- The system should be rechargeable and charging should be supplied directly from the power outlet. The rechargeable battery should be non-removable. When fully charged, the batteries should last for a minimum of 5 hours. 
- The system should be portable enough to be carried by a single person for connection to the power outlet for charging.
- Nothing can be attached to the animals.
- The system should be adaptive to feeding regime variety of different cats.

We want a connected system such that the following features related to the status of the device should be observable via the internet.

- Status of the food supply
- Battery level both during charging and operation
- Feeding logs
- Cat Profiles
