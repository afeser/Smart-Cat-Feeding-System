\section{Executive Summary} \label{sec:exec_sum}

As the human race began interacting with cats millenniums ago, the relationship between cat and human only got stronger. This led to the domestication of cats today known as Felis Catus. Because of this, cats have achieved world domination with a population of 600 million. With the vast growing population, the responsibility that humans have is to take care of them as much as possible whether outdoors, in sanctuaries or just in our homes. This project tackles this issue from the feeding point of view, with this technology workload of humans are eased and there is no single cat left that goes by with a hungry stomach.
