## Installation
Simply run "setup" file as a bash script. Arguments specify whether build is for client or server.

Under "build" folder, there are files to make the system work.

Some notes :
- No compilation needed
- Run both on server and client with different arguments ("./setup client" or "./setup server")



## Repo Structure
Please do not commit **ANY** changes to master unless they are major and tested. Only LTS versions could exist in the master branch and they should be cleared from small and confusing commits. Keeping the commits stable and under control, please commit as little as possible to the master branch.

On the other hand branches are open to any commit, and everyone is encouraged to commit as much as possible. These commits will be rebased(squashed) into a single version in master.

This branch is to keep branch structure in each version. Only emerging changes will be made to master, others should appear in this branch.
