# How to write reports?
Sub-directories contain sources files whereas FinalProject/Report directory contains the pdf files.

It is messy when .pdf files appear in Week folders, therefore please rename the report to the name of the week and move it to directly under Reports f
older.


## Notes
- main.pdf files are ignored!
- Example directory structure:
  - Week1/   # Week 1 source files
  - Week2/   # Week 2 source files
  - ...
  - Week(n)/ # Week n source files
  - ##### DOCUMENT FILES BELOW
  - Week1.pdf   # Week 1 report
  - Week2.pdf   # Week 2 report
  - ...
  - Week(n).pdf # Week n report
- Please do not include the compiler files such as .bbl, .gz etc.
