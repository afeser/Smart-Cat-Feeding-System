###### Disclaimer: This `README` file steals sentences from [the department's website](https://capstone.eee.metu.edu.tr/conceptual-design-report/), sometimes without showing the arguably necessary decency to even paraphrase them.

## Careful - feedback from Mr. Çiloğlu

###### The cover page of the Proposal Report resembled that of a course assignment. It is only fair to be more professional this time.

###### Deliverables should not mention reports and `feeding diets of the various cats`.

###### Conclusion should be handled better

# Conceptual Design Report

## What is a Conceptual Design?

+ An outline solution to a design problem

+ A means to maximize the probability of a feasible final product

+ A result of thinking out-of-the-box and questioning even the most widely accepted methods

## How is this report different from the Proposal Report?

+ Hopefully the cover page is more professional

+ Technical and implementation details at a subsystem level

+ Algorithm descriptions

+ Test plans and results for subsystems

+ Technically oriented reader

## What should be included?

+ A high level overview of the design (in the form of a block diagram of interacting sub-systems)

+ Estimates of cost, weight, overall dimensions and power consumption

+ Decisions about major design features of sub-systems and major algorithms with reasons, backed by experiments

+ Sub-system tests
