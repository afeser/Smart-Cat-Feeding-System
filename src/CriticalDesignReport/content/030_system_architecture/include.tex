\section{System Architecture}
\label{sec:system_architecture}
The architecture is the most crucial part of the system that designates the relationships between each components. How components are connected, their interaction, and the behaviour of the system with the reasoning for the requirements and problems discussed. How system make decision, handle situation, manage all parts of it are all explained in this section.

This section explains computation steps, more detailed data communication strategy, software architecture, and user interface design specifications as well as critical implementation details. Following two sections, section \ref{sec:server_client} and section \ref{sec:user_interface} explains these aspects in detail.
