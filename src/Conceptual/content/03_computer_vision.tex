\section{Computer Vision} \label{sec:cv}
Feeding cats, deterring dogs, and adjusting system behaviour based on the given cat identities, computer vision part carries the core responsibility and major development requirements in the overall project. Technologies that are going to be used in these processes, methods and optimization methods that are going to be used in these parts are presented in this section.

Computer vision is divided into two separate sub categories: finding object class and identifying the object. The details are explained in corresponding subsections of this section. 

%In contrast to the similarity between the two, completely separate and independent algorithms are developed to achieve this aim.
